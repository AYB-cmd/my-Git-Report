        <h2>Discover GIT</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature,
           actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous
            creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git
             for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have
              worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and 
              it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
          Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control 
          System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is
           common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, 
           every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history
            of all changes.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access 
            to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had formerly used
             to maintain the project.[14] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free
              use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse 
              engineering the BitKeeper protocols.[15] The same incident also spurred the creation of another
               version-control system, Mercurial.</p>

          <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
          <p>A Version Control System usually has three core functionalities, all of which Linus built into
             Git. It must be able store content, track changes to said content (all history including merge
              metadata), and optionally distribute the content and commit history with project collaborators.</p>
